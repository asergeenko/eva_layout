"""
Test for SSANG YONG REXTON 4 carpets bin packing behavior.

This test validates that the bin packing algorithm correctly handles geometric constraints.
Despite having only 57% area utilization, the 4 SSANG YONG REXTON 4 carpets cannot 
all fit on a single 140x200 cm sheet due to their irregular shapes and sizes.

The algorithm correctly places 3 carpets and leaves 1 unplaced, demonstrating that
geometric constraints are more restrictive than simple area calculations.

This test should be run whenever the bin packing algorithm is modified to ensure
correct behavior is maintained.
